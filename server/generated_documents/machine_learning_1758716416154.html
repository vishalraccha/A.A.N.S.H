Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time through experience. This is achieved by using statistical techniques to analyze data and build models that can generalize to new, unseen data.</p><h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2><p>Machine learning is broadly categorized into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models to predict outcomes (e.g., image classification). Unsupervised learning analyzes unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns and structures (e.g., customer segmentation). Reinforcement learning involves training agents to make decisions in an environment to maximize rewards (e.g., game playing).</p></body></html>
