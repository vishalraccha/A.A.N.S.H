Its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) capability, achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), makes it highly portable. Key features include automatic garbage collection, strong memory management, and a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.</p><h2>Core Java Concepts</h2><p>Fundamental concepts in Java include object-oriented programming principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism), data types (primitives and objects), control structures (loops, conditionals), exception handling, and input/output operations. Understanding these core concepts is crucial for building robust and efficient Java applications.</p></body></html>
